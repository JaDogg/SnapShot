SnapShot README
===============

SnapShot is designed to run from cron, and will take regular backups of
specified folders.

The concept is based on long-standing practice in the UNIX world with
hard-links, but more specifically, the shell script by Mike Rubel was
used as a starting point.

In fact, I first used Mike's script, and then made my own perl version.

The significant conceptual changes I have made are:

1. Use date-based names instead of relative names. This aids sorting
2. use a central configuration file.
3. Enable locking of folders to allow concurrent snapshot backups, as
   well as enabling the entire snapshot volume to be backed up to
   remote storage.
